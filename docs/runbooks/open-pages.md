# Runbook: open-pages.py

## Description
Extracts URLs from a Markdown file and opens them as tabs in a new Firefox window. It is designed to quickly verify links generated by research or LLM processes.

## Prerequisites
- **Python 3.x:** Must be installed.
- **Mozilla Firefox:** Must be installed.

## Usage
The script is available via the `open-pages` alias.
```bash
open-pages -i <path_to_markdown_file>
```
Example:
```bash
open-pages -i data/input/SC5_Research_Sources-v2-c.md
```

## Features
- **Dry Run:** Use `--dry-run` to see the list of URLs found without opening Firefox.
- **Validity Check:** Use `--valid` to check for 404 "Not Found" errors without opening the browser.
- **Path Support:** Supports absolute, relative, and home (`~/`) paths.
- **Deduplication:** Automatically removes duplicate URLs from the file.
- **Safety Limit:** If more than 50 unique URLs are found, it prompts for confirmation before opening the first 50.
- **New Window:** Opens a fresh Firefox window to avoid cluttering your current session.
